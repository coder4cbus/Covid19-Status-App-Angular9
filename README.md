I made the responsive CoronaVirus Tracker Web Application in Angular 9 with various dependencies availabel in package.json file.
I also hosted this project on my GitHub account.

                      Below is my project link:
    https://rahul360prasad.github.io/Covid19-Status-App-Angular9/

Note:- 
There are some important commands for and for if deployment is successful but the application is not open,      shows blank page then the fault is in index.html file <base href="/"> in this tag.
        Change this tag into <base href="./"> format only the "." is missing before forward slash.

        After any modification is done in project then run these command which automatically make changes into github project.
        Commands:
        1. git add .
        2. git commit -m "first commit"
        3. git push -u origin master
        4. ng deploy
